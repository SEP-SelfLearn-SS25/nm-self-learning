## Database

This project uses [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) for database access.

To interact with the database, you can use code like the following:

```ts
import type { User } from "@prisma/client"; // User is generated by Prisma
import { database } from "@self-learning/database";

function getUserById(id: string): Promise<User> {
	// all properties (user, id, ...) are type-safe!
	return database.user.findUnique({
		where: {
			id: id
		}
	});
}
```

**Development only**: After making changes to the database schema ([libs/data-access//database/prisma/schema.prisma](libs/data-access//database/prisma/schema.prisma)), use the following command to push these changes to the database:

```
npm run prisma db push
```

Prisma generates code according to the defined database schema. After making changes to the schema, you must trigger the code generation via the following command:

```
npm run prisma generate
```

Fill database with demo data, which is defined in [seed.ts](libs/data-access/database/src/lib/seed.ts):

```
npm run prisma seed
```
