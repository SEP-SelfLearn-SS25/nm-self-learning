## 🎯 Project Goal

Our main goal is to develop two new dashboard features for the self-learn platform:
1.  **Student Dashboard:** To provide students with visual data on their study time and performance, along with achievements and personalized suggestions to enhance their learning journey.
2.  **Course Creator Dashboard:** To help professors and course creators track and analyze student enrollment data to gain insights into course popularity and engagement.
